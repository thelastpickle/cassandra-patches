# cassandra-patches

This repo serves as a dumping ground for our patches to Apache Cassandra.  Some of them will have been submitted to the Apache Cassandra project already, some have been merged, and some may have even been rejected.  Some are backports of bug fixes or features to a previous version.  It should be assumed that a given patch should be applied to the latest bug fix of a particular version.

Each directory contains a list of patches and a README.  The README should have a brief explanation of each patch.

These patches come with no guarantee, warrentee, etc.  Use at your own risk.
